# SpringBoot_ParkingSpot
A Clean Spring Boot Project with REST, JPA and Security

This is a personal project developed to study the Spring Boot Framework. Using the Java language, I developed a simple project that receives REST requests from any client (front-end) to save, find, update or delete models. The project model is a Parking Spot Control system, where it is possible to manage the use/vacancy of a parking lot.

This project is for study purposes only and serves as a guide for new and great projects with Spring Boot.
